# Decdion-tree-ID3-algorithm-implementation

This is a programming asssignment to fulfill my machine learning course assignment. I used the ID3 algorith to create
an a decison tree with the entropy calues at the nodes and classification result at a leaf node. i stored this result 
in an XML file which is also included in this repository.
The trainig data was from UCI machine learning repository at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation
